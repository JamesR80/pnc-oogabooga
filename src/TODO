Ron Gilbert on Tweens I Guess

The doors are power by something in my  engine called Motors. They can move a object's property from one state to another (position, scale, rotation, color, etc).  My motors have about 10 different types, from linear, sin, bounce, pop, etc.  Currently I've only exposed the linear to the scripts. In the final game, objects like the door would get a small bounce motor type.

They just iterate from a START to an END value over a TIME using various functions like linear, easeIn, easeOut, sin, bounce, etc. You attach the motor to a property (position, scale, color, alpha, rotation, etc) and they get called every frame and do their work. Once you start a motor, you don't have to worry about it until it's done. It can die on it's own, or it can do a callback when it finishes. They are magical.
